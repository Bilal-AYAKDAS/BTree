## BTree
#TraverseBTree Method:
The node (which is sent) is going null it returns nothing.
For loop sends node’s children to function as recursive.
The function continues until the last node’s goes null because 0’s 
the node will be a node that carries the smallest value,
then it starts 0 and writes left side children which means smaller than the root,
then it writes root, then it writes right side children which means bigger than root. 
Thus, it sorts them from smallest to biggest.
